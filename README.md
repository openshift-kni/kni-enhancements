# OpenShift-KNI Proposals/Enhancements

***Note: This repository is for OpenShift-KNI related features. The
main [OpenShift
Enhancements](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements) repository
should be used for general OpenShift features.***

This repository contains proposals for features/enhancements which
generally address use cases under the openshift-kni domain but which
are narrower in size, scope, and impact than would be covered in the
[OpenShift Enhancements](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements)
repository from which this repository is heavily inspired and derived.

The intent of this repository is to provide a space where discussions
over features and design decisions can happen in an open and
collaborative forum. Participation by anyone who is interested is
highly encouraged. Use of this repository is optional. Teams, feature
developers, or stakeholders can choose to use this space as best suits
their needs.

The question may come up as to whether a proposal should be added to
this repository or to the main [OpenShift
Enhancements](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements). If in doubt,
you should start with the broader audience found in the main
enhancements repository.

New enhancements should start with the example [OpenShift Enhancement
Template](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/guidelines/enhancement_template.md)
